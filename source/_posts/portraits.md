"Can you take a picture of me?" I get this request quite often. Most of the time I get this request at parties. At rare occasions I get this question so much that I can't do my work anymore and I just pack my gear and leave. Since I take a lot of pictures of strangers, I do feel I should return something back by giving in to these requests now and then. But my heart is not in it.

I like to hunt for spontaneous photos where people are busy among themselves. When people notice you, they start to pose and the photo is then reduced to a mere obligatory snapshot with the ubiquitous thumbs up and forced happy faces. Sometimes it does result in an interesting portrait but most of the time it doesn't.

Often I still publish such photos because it still attracts attention on the social media as it increases the visibility of my account. I have enough followers in my municipality that there's always somebody that recognizes a person in my pictures and then tags that person. I publish these photo's bundled in one post so it's clear they are less valuable to me than the photos I publish post by post.

Anyway, last week I struggled. I was at the opening of a skate park. As a street photographer I like dynamic scenes but this was more like sports photography which I don't have much experience in. So although I took some OK photos I wasn't happy with myself. I was ready to pack my gear and leave. And then came that question: "Can you take a picture of me?"

The question came from a skater whom I took some action photos some minutes before. The young black youngster with rasta hair definitively radiated coolness but I was in doubt. Will this just be another snapshot? But I realised it was just the second request that day so after some hesitation I agreed and unpacked the cameras again.

But this time this wasn't going to be just a simple snapshot. He wanted to have a portrait on the skatepark. While walking back to that place, I had some time to think about the scene that I wanted to make.

**Spending some extra thinking on what would be a nice portrait, together with the expectation from the subject that a portrait needs to be taken in context really made the difference.** When I started shooting for the portrait, I already knew what kind of picture I was going for. The result is this cool portrait. ‚ù¶
