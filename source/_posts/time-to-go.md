During a photo session you often know when it's time to pack your bag and go. You start to meet the same people at an event. Or you start feeling discomfort as you walk around visiting the same places. The smaller the pond you fish in, the faster you're out of fish. But I learned the bingo is different, though.

I've never taken photos of a bingo so I was thrilled to be at one. I had a bit of a hiatus from photography and this seemed like a good opportunity to get back in the saddle again. And things seem promising: a room with 100 people or more, mostly concerned about the numbers on a sheet before them.

As always, I start preparing my cameras. I find it a good activity to transition into full photographer mode. Even while I was busy with preparations, some looked over their shoulders to see what I'm doing. A hint for what was to come.

Even though the bingo was a happy occasion, it was also a quiet one. People need to hear the numbers being announced. And even when this didn't happen because the jury needed to check the the bingo card of a winner, there wasn't much sound. In contrast with other activities like carnival, **the clicking of my camera was noticeable**.

So I quickly switched to telephoto lenses to take pictures of people without getting too close to them. Even though that worked, I could tell people were keeping an eye on me. Not that I was a nuisance (I think) but because I triggered curiosity.

So got up the stairs and took pictures from a high angle. But even then, people at some point looked up to see what I was doing.

When I tried to get more close with a 50mm equivalent lens, people started to giggle. Sometimes this works well: you make contact with your subjects, have a chat and maybe even take a photo while talking. In this case though, the group giggled too loud so I soon made my way to another table.

Then came my rescue: the organisation announced that this was the last bingo session before the break. I quickly made the best of the time that was left and when people started to make their way to the bar, I felt relieved and start packing.

**Bingo turned out to be an adventure.**

Side note: bingo is apparently still pretty much a gender thing. I only noticed halfway that only about 3 of the 100+ participants were actually male.
