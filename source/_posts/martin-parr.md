If I have to name photographers that are an inspiration for me, then there's only one name that I can say without thinking: Martin Parr.

The moment I encountered his photos from New Brighton I was hooked. I liked his way of looking at things. He combined the banal, the bizarre, social critique and light humor in one neat package. And even though my photography is different from his, whenever I review my own work, I can't help to do that in relation to Martin Parr's work.

Photography is a very diverse landscape. From nature to sports and from news to fine art, no photographer is the same. But if you ask me what photography should be, I'd say that the work of Martin Parr has been a gold standard for me so far. He may have died but I am sure his photography will outlast us all.
