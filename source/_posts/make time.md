It's so trite: people complain that they can't find the time to go out and take photos. And yet, this is actually what I'm struggling with at times. There are two things that keep me from going out and taking pictures: I either don't have the time for it or I'm not motivated. Let's dive into both issues.

## No time

This one is the simplest of the two. Bar exceptions, we can always win time by either dropping activities or responsibilities or by combining activities with photography. Simple, right? Yes and no. I know the solution is quite clear but deciding which thing I need to cut out or dial back is hard. Should I produce less podcasts? Or spend less time on career, the garden or learning Russian? They all seem to be important. The slack time I have through the day is also valuable because I need down time as well. Still I found some strategies that helped me taking more photos. And some that won't. ðŸ˜…

### What works for me

**Have a camera at hand** - I always have one in my shoulder bag or backpack. Not that I encounter a lot of opportunities to grab my camera. Often my focus is with other things than photography (see "Multitasking"). But at least I have a camera at hand when I need one.

**Find inspiration close to home** - Or even better: in home. Sometimes I look at the garden or some place in the house and really appreciate how it looks like. Then I get my camera and just take the photo. I have some photos of the interior of my first house and it's always a pleasure to see them again. So I know I'll also like the interior photos that I take now.

### What does not work for me (yet)

**Multitasking** - Most of the time I'm out, I'm on a mission: supermarket, a meeting, commute, whatever. My mind is focused on arriving on time and most of the time I have a folding bike and a backpack. This conflicts with how I want to take pictures: travel light and no obligations to your agenda or other people.

### What might work

**Diversify** - ...

## Motivation

Sometimes I don't feel like going out to make pictures. These moments are more worrisome for me as I then notice that I lose interest in something that I would normally like to do.

Most of it is just getting out of the house. Once I'm taking pictures, everything is just fine. But quite often it's also a sign that I'm doing too much. I don't have enough down time and this results in losing interest in things that I normally like to do.

This year I skipped some events that I normally always attend like the yearly fairground. There was too much to do at home and I didn't feel like going out. Although I don't like the fact that I stay home, I trust that this is just a temporary thing. Eventually my situation changes and new head space is created for me to work with.

And what if my lack of motivation does not return? Well, assuming that I don't have a burnout, I might actually just lost interest in my hobby. That's a sobering conclusion but not the end of the world. Having 1500+ followers on social networks is great but should not become a boring responsibility. âœ¸
