Can you publish your photos on social media without being social yourself?

I have always been in love with computers. I've been using various sources of social media for ages and in late 2017 I started posting my photos regularly on various channels. In the beginning I was very active on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and tried to connect with other photographers and other independent content creators.

But it was also challenging to combine family life and work with my hobbies and interests. I'm constantly trying to learn or to do something. My phone was the ideal tool for it. It's my mobile bookshelf, radio, music collection, newspaper, translator and connection to the world. I could fill any spare moment with something useful. And so I did.

I know, there's only 24 hours in a day but I have been good in making the best out of it. Up until a few years ago when it became apparent that I didn't have that 24 hour focus anymore. And so I have been retreating little by little from my phone. I replaced colourful icons with dull text, I furiously curated which app can throw which notification at me and as many, I tried apps to control how much time I spent on other apps.

Although all these things helped a little bit, the best thing I could do is to remove social media from my phone altogether. This was a hard choice because I regularly publish content on it and I'm used on checking throughout the day how well or bad a photo is received. I did that multiple times a day which didn't really make sense. I like it when people like the photos I published after careful curation and final edits. It's great when your creative work is appreciated. But I don't need to keep myself updated _that_ regularly. **Maybe the current state of social media has become a net negative to people's life.**

So am I now only taking and not giving? Well, a do return my appreciation for whatever other people are doing but hardly enough. Social media is something I limited to just my laptop. This helps me to surpress the urge to take my phone when there's a moment of silence. As an experiment, I now try to keep my phone out of reach and for some time I will not use it to listen to podcasts or music. It was necessary because without social media I just started doing other stuff on my phone. Not because there was other interesting stuff but because I was used to do something with my phone.

So I started checking the weather, checking my bank account, check if somebody posted an update on WhatsApp. Multiple times a day. Why? The experiment is still ongoing but up until now it has been positive. Even though it does make me feel like an old man in an awfully quiet house where you can only hear the clock ticking.

But back on the subject of social media. I currently just don't have the focus to stay on top of what happens online. It didn't really work for me back then and it surely doesn't work now. And I think it's OK to take pictures and throw them at the public without real online interaction. I love it when my work is being appreciated but that doesn't mean that I have to go online to do the same in return. If my work would be in a museum, I also wouldn't attend every exhibition of others. I just don't have the capacity to do that.

Things change all the time and my current approach to social media will probably change over time as well. For now, just broadcasting my work on social media is good enough for me. Everybody has their own way of handling social media. This is mine for now. I don't know what's yours but **I urge you to keep creating and sharing with others. Your creativity is -in a small way- a blessing to this world.**
