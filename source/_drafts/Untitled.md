I never go out. That is, not without my camera. Before picking up street photography, I much rather have a friend come over meet each other in a pub. I especially was fed up with festivals: walking all day aimlessly from stage to stage, squinting to get a glimpse of a band on the horizon, you're don't really care for in the first place. Listening to music with a sound quality so poor it can only hint at the quality of the studio recording. And I'd swear the singer could actually sing on in the studio. But get on a tangent here.

With the camera, everything is different. Then I'm actually not there. I'm not really participating, I'm looking for photos to make. And when I see an opportunity and dive into the viewfinder, I'm gone. There's only that beautiful scene I'm seeing of which I suddenly feel part of. Just for a moment I feel like I'm there without actually being there. You get it? Probably not but that's OK. It's hard to put into words the feeling street photography can give to me.

What probably is clear is that that is the moment I am appreciating the event I'm visiting. I enjoy it through the joy of others while capturing that precious fleeting moment. I'm a sucker for it. And it makes me feel alive.

Am I then a complete einzelg√§nger when going out with my camera? Far from it! Don't expect to take photos of strangers without exchanging a word with them. With my 3 cameras around my neck and shoulders I often draw attention even before I start shooting. And that's the charm of it: a short chat here, you drop a smile to somebody over there. There's an abundance of little pleasing interactions.
