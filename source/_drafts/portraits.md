"Can you take a picture of me?" I get this request quite often. Most of the time I get this request at festivities. At rare this question occurs so much that I can't do my work anymore and I just pack my gear and leave. Since I take a lot of pictures of strangers, I do feel I should return something by giving in to these requests now and then. But my heart is not in it.

I like to hunt for spontaneous photos where people are busy among themselves. When subjects notice you and start to pose, the photo is reduced to a mere obligatory snapshot with the ubiquitous thumbs up and happy faces. Sometimes it does work out but most of the time it doesn't.

Often I do still publish those and other photos that I don't deem worthy to publish on social media because it still attracts attention. I have enough followers in my municipality that there's always somebody that recognizes somebody in the pictures and tags that person. This is one way I get more followers. I publish these photo's bundled in one post so it's clear they are of a lesser quality than the photos I publish post by post.

Anyway, last week I struggled. I was at the opening of a skate park. As a street photographer I like dynamic scenes but this was more like sports photography which I struggle at. So although I took some OK photos I wasn't happy with myself. I was ready to pack my gear and leave. And then came that question: "Can you take a picture of me?"

The question came from a skater of which I took some action photos some moments before. The young black youngster with rasta hair would definitely make a cool portrait but I was in doubt. But it was just the second request that day so after some hesitation I agreed and unpacked the cameras again.

This time though we had to walk back to the skate park area which gave me some time to think about the scene that I wanted to make. So having some thinking time and that skate park is an awesome background for photos, resulted in a very cool portrait. âœ¸
