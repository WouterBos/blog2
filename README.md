# GUO Blog

Blog based on <a href="https://hexo.io">Hexo</a>. You can find in-depth documentation there.

## Getting started

This website requires NodeJS.

- `npm install` to install all components to build the website.
- `npm run start` to view the website locally.
- `npm run build` to build the website. The website files are exported to `public/`.
- Sometimes it seems like changes in the website aren't picked up. Run `npm run clean` to have a clean build.

## Folders

- `source/_drafts` - Articles that you can see during development but are not exported during a build.
- `source/_posts` - Published articles.
- `themes/wbo` - Theme for this blog. It's based on another theme so there are some unused files.
